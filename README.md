# NYU-Greene-HPC-Cheatsheet
Written by [Yuanhe Guo](https://ricercarg.github.io) (yg2709@nyu.edu)

A beginner guide for getting started with running python on nyu greene hpc.

Each time I want to setup a new environment on NYU Greene HPC, I have to go through the official documentation and search for the commands I need. Meanwhile, there exist quite a few common issues whose solutions are not covered by the offical documentation. So I decided to write a cheatsheet for myself and others who may need it. 

I wrote some complex commands into bash scripts, so that getting python run flawlessly on NYU Greene HPC is as simple as ordering a burger in a fast food restaurant.

**Check the [wiki page](https://github.com/RicercarG/NYU-Greene-HPC-Cheatsheet/wiki) to get started.**
