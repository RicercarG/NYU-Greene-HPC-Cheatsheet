#Trouble Shooting
## Quota Storage
* Check disk storage
If you encounter the problem of "Disk quota exceeded", don't panic, you can check your disk storage by:

```
myquota
```
* Check the size of each folder
```
du -h --max-depth 1
```
* Check file numbers in each folder
```
for d in $(find $(pwd) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | sort -u); do n_files=$(find $d | wc -l); echo $d $n_files; done
```

Delete files in `$Home` (most probably python packages), then you will be fine


## CPU&GPU Runtime
* Check CPU
```
ssh <node-name>
top -u $USER
```
* Check GPU
```
ssh <node-name>
nvidia-smi
```
